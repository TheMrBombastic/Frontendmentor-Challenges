## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements



## My process
I put the written cotent in main. Made a gridbox for the responsive Layout. I played a bit with a flexbox for the bigger screensizes to justify the content better in the main container. Applying vw relation on the body 
font size gives nice responsivness on bigger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Fluency.

### Continued development

I would like to play around with flex and grid for nice responsivness.
